# Anime-Sama API

## Overview

This is a Node.js-based API that scrapes the anime-sama.fr website to provide anime data in real-time. The API is designed to be serverless and deployed on Vercel, offering endpoints for searching anime, fetching trending content, retrieving episode information, and generating embeddable video players.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Vercel Functions
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for making web requests
- **HTML Parser**: Cheerio for DOM manipulation and data extraction
- **Deployment**: Vercel serverless functions using the `/api` directory structure
- **CORS**: Configured to allow cross-origin requests from any domain

### Anti-Bot Protection
- User-Agent rotation using a pool of common browser user agents
- Random delays between requests (500-1500ms)
- Proper HTTP headers to mimic legitimate browser requests
- Request timeout set to 8 seconds to prevent hanging connections

## Key Components

### API Endpoints
1. **Search API** (`/api/search`) - Search for anime by query string
2. **Trending API** (`/api/trending`) - Get currently trending anime
3. **Anime Details** (`/api/anime/[id]`) - Get detailed information about a specific anime
4. **Seasons** (`/api/seasons/[animeId]`) - Get available seasons for an anime
5. **Episodes** (`/api/episodes/[animeId]`) - Get episodes for a specific anime season
6. **Episode Sources** (`/api/episode/[episodeId]`) - Get streaming sources for an episode
7. **Embed Player** (`/api/embed`) - Generate embeddable HTML player
8. **Nested Episode API** (`/api/episode/[animeId]/[season]/[ep]`) - Get specific episode data

### Core Utilities
- **Scraper Module** (`/utils/scraper.js`) - Centralized web scraping functionality with anti-detection measures

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Development vs production error detail exposure
- Graceful fallbacks for scraping failures

## Data Flow

1. **Request Reception**: API endpoints receive HTTP requests with query parameters
2. **Parameter Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
3. **Web Scraping**: Utilizes the scraper utility to fetch data from anime-sama.fr
4. **Data Processing**: Cheerio parses HTML and extracts structured data
5. **Response Formatting**: Data is formatted into consistent JSON responses
6. **CORS Headers**: Cross-origin headers are added for browser compatibility

## External Dependencies

### NPM Packages
- **axios** (^1.10.0) - HTTP client for web requests
- **cheerio** (^1.1.0) - Server-side DOM manipulation
- **cors** (^2.8.5) - Cross-origin resource sharing middleware

### Target Website
- **anime-sama.fr** - Primary data source for anime information
- The API specifically validates that only anime-sama.fr URLs are processed for security

## Deployment Strategy

### Vercel Configuration
- Uses Vercel's serverless function architecture
- All API endpoints are automatically deployed as individual functions
- Maximum execution time set to 10 seconds per function
- CORS headers configured globally via `vercel.json`

### Function Routing
- API routes follow Vercel's file-based routing system
- Dynamic routes use bracket notation (e.g., `[id].js`, `[animeId]/[season]/[ep].js`)
- Nested routing supported for complex endpoint structures

### Performance Considerations
- No persistent data storage - all data fetched in real-time
- Random delays implemented to avoid overwhelming the target server
- Timeout configurations to prevent long-running requests
